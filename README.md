# Hey there, I'm Pepe! ðŸ‘‹

## A bit about me...

Born in Spain and diving deep into the tech world as a computer science student. I'm also kicking off my physics degree online because why not? Life's too short not to explore the mysteries of the universe and the digital realm, right?

### What's cooking in my tech kitchen?

- **Languages & Tools:** I love coding in Python, Java, C and Typescriot/Javascript.
- **I'm Learning:** Encription and decription algorithms in low level sense. 
- **The Geeky Side:** Physics isn't just for the labs, and I'm all about figuring out why things are the way they are. Also, big fan of asking "Why?" about, well, everything.

### Beyond the screen

- **Thinking Hat:** Philosophy's my go-to for deep dives. What's life? Why do we do what we do? And yeah, I do have thoughts on how society ticks.
- **Finding My Path:** Life's a journey, and I'm mapping mine out. Expect detours and deep thoughts.
